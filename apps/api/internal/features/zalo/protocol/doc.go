// Package protocol speaks Zalo's personal-account web protocol.
//
// It is a reverse-engineered, unofficial client. Zalo publishes no contract for
// any endpoint used here, ships no compatibility guarantee, and can change the
// wire format without notice — when that happens this package breaks and has to
// be re-ported. Keep it small for exactly that reason.
//
// Scope: authentication — QR link (LoginQR) and cookie re-login
// (LoginWithCredentials), plus the Session and Credentials values that carry
// state between them; the friend list (FetchFriends); text DMs (SendMessage);
// phone-to-account lookup (FindUser); and single friend requests
// (SendFriendRequest). Groups, media, and the WebSocket listener are
// deliberately absent.
//
// The package is quarantined: it imports nothing from the rest of the API, so it
// can be deleted or swapped wholesale. Credentials produced here are full
// account-takeover material — callers must encrypt them at rest and keep them
// out of logs and API responses.
